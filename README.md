# todo-list

Create a ToDo List app using HTML, CSS, and Local Storage.
Your ToDo List app should enable a user to create a list of tasks to complete. The page should display the list of tasks and an HTML form for creating a new task. The list of tasks should be stored in local storage so that the list of tasks are available whenever someone returns to the web application.

Ensure that your ToDo List app satisfies the following requirements:

Each task object should have an id, name, date created, and is completed property.
The list of tasks should be displayed in an HTML table with separate columns for each task property.
Each row should include a checkbox that indicates whether the task is completed.
The page should include an HTML form for adding new tasks to the ToDo List.
The tasks should be stored in Local Storage so that when you refresh the page, the task list remains
Please use HTML/CSS to make the ToDo List app as visually pleasant as possible.
